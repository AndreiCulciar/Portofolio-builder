# Portofolio-builder
Project meant to scrape the wep in search of stocks to build an efficient portofolio
Files:
Untitled1.py: Extract the first number of most active stocks on Yahoo Finnance (To do: Make the number of stocks  dynamic)
Untitled2.py: Extract the values in between two manually selected dates (To do: Make the date selection dynamic)
Untitled3.py: Determine the position to be taken on every stock
Untitled4.py: Controls the graphics
Untitled5.ipynb: Michelenious matters, most importantly it turns Untitled4.py into Untitled4.exe after eventual modifications on the .py file


Optimisation score: LMAO
