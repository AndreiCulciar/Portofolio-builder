# Portofolio-builder

Project meant to scrape the wep in search of stocks to build an efficient portofolio

Files:

Untitled1.py: Extract the first number of most active stocks on Yahoo Finnance

Untitled2.py: Extract the values in between two manually selected dates

Untitled3.py: Determine the position to be taken on every stock

Untitled4.py: Controls the graphics

Untitled5.ipynb: Michelenious matters, most importantly it turns Untitled4.py into Untitled4.exe, after eventual modifications on the .py file

Overall to do: Make the paths dynamic (done)

To do: 
1. Expand the algoritm
2. Apply better logic in regards to numbers
3. Review the "Show pie" and "Show positions" commands
